The destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina was heralded as a wake-up call for the U.S., a catastrophe that illustrated the scale of the threat from natural disasters, and the inadequacy of preparations.

But for all the earnest talk of 'learning lessons' that followed, no grand reform agenda was put in place to revitalize a city that remains devastated and deeply vulnerable.


Hurricane Sandy underlined the urgency by ruthlessly exposing New York's structural weaknesses, paralyzing power, water and transport networks as the lights went off across Manhattan. California also suffered as historic droughts settled in, and the 2014 wave of winter storms terrorized the North, emphasizing that extreme conditions were here to stay and could strike anywhere.
